# etsy-recreation

Re-Create An Etsy Page - https://www.etsy.com/search?q=yarn

Specifically you need to focus on the sidebar and the main content of items.
Create your own API token by signing up as an ETSY DEVELOPER
Fetch data from the API using whatever search term you'd like - SAMPLE DATA HERE
Use bootstrap to help you out (optional, but suggested)
Everything should be styled as closely as possible
You should implement hover events and link the items to their proper Etsy product pages
Unless you do the bonus question #2, you can just put random links in your sidebar
Making the form elements work is not a requirement
